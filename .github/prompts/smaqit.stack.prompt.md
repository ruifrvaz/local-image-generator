<!-- Example: "No external dependencies - standard library only" -->

### Constraints
[What are the technology limitations?]

<!-- Example: "Must run on Windows, macOS, and Linux" -->
<!-- Example: "Target Python beginners - simple syntax" -->

### Build Tools
[What build system or tooling do you need?]

<!-- Example: "Standard Python packaging - no special build tools" -->

### Development Environment
[What development setup is required?]

<!-- Example: "Python 3.11+ interpreter" -->
<!-- Example: "Text editor or IDE with Python support" -->

### Dependencies
[What libraries or packages are needed?]
