# Functional Prompt

This prompt captures functional requirements for your project. These requirements will be used to generate functional specifications.

## Requirements

### User Experience
[What experience should users have?]

<!-- Example: "Console output shows Mario greeting immediately on launch" -->
<!-- Example: "Application runs without user interaction" -->

### Behaviors
[What should the system do?]

<!-- Example: "Display Mario's iconic catchphrase 'It's-a me, Mario!'" -->
<!-- Example: "Exit cleanly after displaying message" -->

### Interactions
[How do users or systems interact?]

<!-- Example: "No user input required - automatic execution" -->
<!-- Example: "Console output visible before application closes" -->

### Data Models
[What data does the system work with?]

<!-- Example: "Greeting message - String containing Mario's catchphrase" -->

### State Transitions
[How does the system change over time?]

<!-- Example: "Starting → Display Message → Exit" -->

### API Contracts
[What interfaces exist between components?]

<!-- Example: "GreetingService.getGreeting() → String" -->
